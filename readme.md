# RouteExport
###### A Blender Add-on to simplify the creation of custom world maps for NSMB2

This add-on generates a route and point file based on your NSMB2 world map model.

As it does not generate level unlocks yet, there are still other minor changes to be made to the output file to make it fully usable.

For more documentation about world maps, see: https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13719
